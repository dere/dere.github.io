Hello! My name is Derek Maciel. This site is called `/dev/zero` because it is a lot of nothing. Here you will find posts on the topics that interest me:

* I'm a Computer Science student at Rutgers University.
* I am a student developer and systems administrator at [OSS](http://oss.rutgers.edu), which brings open source software to Rutgers. I am also a former Software Development Intern at [SIG](https://sig.com) and future Software Engineering Intern at Capital One.
* I am a long-time reader of [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) but I have not yet learned to religiously defend my favorite language/editor/widget [in the early hours of the morning](https://xkcd.com/386/). I have also developed from [/r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab) a hunger to acquire server hardware for my apartment (having a *need* for it doesn't appear to be a prerequisite).
* I switched from Windows to Linux because I love how easy it is to get work done. When people point out I actually spend *more* time fiddling with Xorg config files than I ever lost from Windows Update reboots, I try (unsuccessfully) to convince myself that isn't true.


# Email me
I don't want to put my email in plain-text, and
[Cloudflare email address obfuscation](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170016-What-is-Email-Address-Obfuscation-)
requires JavaScript enabled, so... the following is my email address, reversed then base64-encoded:

```
bW9jLmxpYW1nQGdvbGIrbGVpY2FtYWtlcmVk
```

To reveal it, base-64 decode it using one of the many base-64 decoders online
([here's one](https://www.base64decode.org)) then unreverse it. Or if you have
Python 2 or 3 installed you can paste this into a terminal: 


```
$ python -c "from base64 import b64decode as d; print(d('bW9jLmxpYW1nQGdvbGIrbGVpY2FtYWtlcmVk')[::-1])"
```
