Hello, my name is Derek Maciel and I am a software engineer at Capital One.

I am a passionate about the free software movement, and I am thankful to work at [a company that feels the same way](https://opensource.com/business/16/11/capital-one-open-source). I have many fond memories of middle school, installing a new Linux distro literally every week on the [iMac G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3) my single mother was able to procure for the family at a garage sale. I owe my career in computers to my English teacher at the time who never complained about me asking to "borrow" just *one more* writable CD-ROM.

During my undergrad at Rutgers, I worked at a department that brought open source software to the university, aptly named [OSS](https://oss.rutgers.edu). Made up mostly of students, we served almost like consultants for anything related to open source software: we would identify and experiment with solutions to needs the university had, whether that be project management for teams and student organizations or convenient web hosting for faculty. I worked with a lot of passionate students and alumni and I learned a lot while I was there.

In the summer after my sophomore year I was a software engineering intern at [SIG](https://sig.com), a trading firm based in the Philadelphia area. In a small, close-knit, all-hands-on-deck team on the Commodities trading desk, I helped design, implement, and test a new trading platform for a particular financial instrument. I will always remember how my manager made me feel a part of the team on day one, and the amazing events that the internship program planned for us.

In the summer after my junior year, I was a software engineering intern at Capital One on the call center business unit in Wilmington, Delaware. I was surprised to see how seriously Capital One took their mission to be ["cloud first"](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/capital-one/), even their call centers were almost entirely running on AWS! Over the summer I got to work on some interesting projects that allowed me to experience first-hand the business value machine learning could provide to a large company.

For some other facts about me: I am a long-time reader of [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) but I have not yet learned to religiously defend my favorite language/editor/widget [in the early hours of the morning](https://xkcd.com/386/). I have also developed from [/r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab) a hunger to acquire server hardware for my apartment (having a *need* for it doesn't appear to be a prerequisite).
