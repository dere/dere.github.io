Hello, my name is Derek Gurchik and I am a software engineer at Capital One.

Some other facts about me:

 * Some of my earliest memories with computers are me installing a different Linux distro on the family computer each week. As an adult, not much has changed.
 * I am a long-time reader of [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) but I have not yet learned to religiously defend my favorite language/editor/widget [in the early hours of the morning](https://xkcd.com/386/).
 * [/r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab) inspires me daily to acquire ~~loud and expensive space heaters~~ computer equipment *first*, then consider *uses* for them second.
* You can find the public version of my resume [here](https://gurchik.com/derek-gurchik-resume.pdf).
